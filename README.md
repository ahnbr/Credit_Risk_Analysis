# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

- For this project, we wanted to analyze the different factors that are taken into consideration when determining Credit Risk. This would give us insight as to what plays into determining which candidates would be considered high risk or low risk. 

- In our analysis we used several different models and sampled the data in different ways.

- First we decided to utilize scikit-learn and imbalanced-learn to build and evaluate models using resampling as follows below
- The next part included oversampling using RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms
- We then undersampled the data using ClusterCentroids resampler algorithm
- After that, we wanted to use a combination of both over- and undersampling. For this we used SMOTEENN algorithm
- Once we completed this, our final task was to compare two different machine learning models to reduce bias in our data. For this we used BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier.
